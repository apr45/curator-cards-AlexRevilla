## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. The Bauhaus is a German art school founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius with the aim of uniting all forms of art with functionality and mass production. 
2. The Swiss Style is a graphic design style that originated in Switzerland in the 1950s, characterized by elements such as sans-serif fonts, minimalism, grid systems, and asymmetry.
3. New Wave typography emerged in the 1970s as a response to Swiss Style, favoring inconsistent letterspacing, experimental type weights, chaotic compositions, and non-grid-based layouts.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Why did the Nazi regime pressure the Bauhaus to close down?
2. How did Swiss Style influence today's modern design?
3. Why did Wolfgang Weingart broke away of the traditional rules of International Typographic Style?

[Design History Concept Map
Design History Evolution
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)
  * Background: Response to Post-WWI Germany; an attempt to reconcile individual creativity with the manufacturing power of the machine age.
  * Core Principles: "Form follows function," use of geometric shapes, primary color palettes, and the removal of all non-essential decoration.
  * Key Figures: Walter Gropius, Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy.
  * Relationship: The Blueprint. Laid the foundation for modern design; prioritized minimalism and mass production. 
2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
  * Background: Emerged in Switzerland; a need for clear, universal communication
  * Core Principles: Mathematical grid systems, asymmetrical balance, objective photography over illustration, and a preference for Helvetica.
  * Key Figures: Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Emil Ruder.
  * Relationship: The Perfectionist. Refined Bauhaus ideals into a rigid, objective, and globally standardized system.
3. New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)
  * Background: Post-modern revolt against the perceived rigidness and predictability of the Swiss Style.
  * Core Principles: Breaking the grid, overlapping layers, wide letter-spacing, and "intuitive" layouts.
  * Key Figures: Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Dan Friedman.
  * Relationship: The Rebel. It used the technical precision of the Swiss Style but intentionally "shattered" the rules to reintroduce human expression and visual complexity.]

[Bauhaus (1919–1933)
  * Gesamtkunstwerk: A "total work of art" where different art forms are combined as a unified whole.
  * Geometric Abstraction: The use of simple shapes like circles, squares, and triangles as the building blocks of design.
  * Form Follows Function: The principle that the design of an object should be determined solely by its function.
  * Sans-Serif Typography: Letterforms without "feet" (serifs) at the ends of strokes.
  * Modernism: A movement in the arts that aims to break with ornate and traditional styles.
  * Industrial Design: The process of designing products to be mass-produced.
International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
  * Grid System: A mathematical framework used to organize content, ensuring a structured and consistent layout.
  * Asymmetrical Balance: Creating visual harmony through the clever placement of unequal elements rather than mirroring them.
  * Negative Space: The intentional use of empty space between or around subjects of an image to emphasize content.
  * Objective Photography: Using clear, literal photos that aren't influenced by biases, emotions, and interpretations.
  * Left-aligned: Text aligned on the left side only, creating a modern, clean edge that aids readability.
  * Visual Hierarchy: The arrangement of elements to signal importance, usually through varying font sizes and colors.
  * Helvetica: Swiss typeface designed to be neutral and legible, so the message stays clear.
New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)
  * Deconstructed Grid: Taking traditional design "rules" (like the Swiss grid) and intentionally breaking or distorting them.
  * Layering: Overlapping text, images, and patterns to create a sense of depth and visual complexity.
  * Irregular Letterspacing: Intentionally stretching or tightening the space between letters to create a jagged, chaotic look.
  * Mixed Typeweights: Combining bold, light, and condensed fonts within a single sentence or word.
  * High Contrast: A significant difference between the lightest and darkest tones.
  * Halftone Screens: Using visible dot patterns (common in low-budget printing) as a deliberate stylistic choice.
  * Postmodernism: A philosophical, artistic, and cultural reaction against the ideas and values of modernism.]
