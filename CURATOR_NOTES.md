## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. The Bauhaus is a German art school founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius with the aim of uniting all forms of art with functionality and mass production. 
2. The Swiss Style is a graphic design style that originated in Switzerland in the 1950s, characterized by elements such as sans-serif fonts, minimalism, grid systems, and asymmetry.
3. New Wave typography emerged in the 1970s as a response to Swiss Style, favoring inconsistent letterspacing, experimental type weights, chaotic compositions, and non-grid-based layouts.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Why did the Nazi regime pressure the Bauhaus to close down?
2. How did Swiss Style influence today's modern design?
3. Why did Wolfgang Weingart broke away of the traditional rules of International Typographic Style?

Design History Concept Map
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)

  * Background: Weimar Republic, Germany; a response to the Industrial Revolution seeking to merge craft with mass production.

  * Core Principles: "Form follows function," use of geometric primitives (circle, square, triangle), and the integration of art and technology.

  * Key Figures: Walter Gropius, Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy.

  * Relationship: The Foundation. It pioneered the minimalist, sans-serif aesthetic that moved design away from Victorian ornamentation.

2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)

  * Background: Post-WWII Switzerland; focused on creating a "universal" visual language for global communication.

  * Core Principles: Strict adherence to mathematical grid systems, objective clarity, asymmetrical layouts, and the use of Helvetica.

  * Key Figures: Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Emil Ruder.

  * Relationship: The Dogma. It took Bauhaus ideals and codified them into a rigid, scientific system that prioritized legibility over personality.

3. New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)

  * Background: A reaction by designers who felt the Swiss Style had become too predictable and "corporate."

  * Core Principles: Breaking the grid, layered textures, letter-spacing manipulation, and "stair-step" typography.

  * Key Figures: Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Dan Friedman.

  * Relationship: The Rebellion. It utilized the technical foundation of the Swiss Style but intentionally "broke" the rules to reintroduce human intuition and complexity.
