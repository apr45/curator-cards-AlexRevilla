## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. The Bauhaus is a German art school founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius with the aim of uniting all forms of art with functionality and mass production. 
2. The Swiss Style is a graphic design style that originated in Switzerland in the 1950s, characterized by elements such as sans-serif fonts, minimalism, grid systems, and asymmetry.
3. New Wave typography emerged in the 1970s as a response to Swiss Style, favoring inconsistent letterspacing, experimental type weights, chaotic compositions, and non-grid-based layouts.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Why did the Nazi regime pressure the Bauhaus to close down?
2. How did Swiss Style influence today's modern design?
3. Why did Wolfgang Weingart broke away of the traditional rules of International Typographic Style?

Design History Concept Map
Design History Evolution
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)
  * Background: Response to Post-WWI Germany; an attempt to reconcile individual creativity with the manufacturing power of the machine age.
  * Core Principles: "Form follows function," use of geometric shapes, primary color palettes, and the removal of all non-essential decoration.
  * Key Figures: Walter Gropius, Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy.
  * Relationship: The Blueprint. Laid the foundation for modern design; prioritized minimalism and mass production. 
2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
  * Background: Emerged in Switzerland; a need for clear, universal communication
  * Core Principles: Mathematical grid systems, asymmetrical balance, objective photography over illustration, and a preference for Helvetica.
  * Key Figures: Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Emil Ruder.
  * Relationship: The Perfectionist. Refined Bauhaus ideals into a rigid, objective, and globally standardized system.
3. New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)
  * Background: Post-modern revolt against the perceived rigidness and predictability of the Swiss Style.
  * Core Principles: Breaking the grid, overlapping layers, wide letter-spacing, and "intuitive" layouts.
  * Key Figures: Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Dan Friedman.
  * Relationship: The Rebel. It used the technical precision of the Swiss Style but intentionally "shattered" the rules to reintroduce human expression and visual complexity.
