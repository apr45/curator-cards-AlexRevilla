## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. The Bauhaus is a German art school founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius with the aim of uniting all forms of art with functionality and mass production. 
2. The Swiss Style is a graphic design style that originated in Switzerland in the 1950s, characterized by elements such as sans-serif fonts, minimalism, grid systems, and asymmetry.
3. New Wave typography emerged in the 1970s as a response to Swiss Style, favoring inconsistent letterspacing, experimental type weights, chaotic compositions, and non-grid-based layouts.

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Why did the Nazi regime pressure the Bauhaus to close down?
2. How did Swiss Style influence today's modern design?
3. Why did Wolfgang Weingart broke away of the traditional rules of International Typographic Style?

Design Evolution Concept Map: Bauhaus to New Wave
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)
* Background: Post-WWI Germany; aiming to bridge the gap between fine art and industrial mass production.
* Key Figures: Walter Gropius, Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy.
* Core Principles:
* "Form follows function": Aesthetic is derived from utility.
* Geometric Reduction: Use of basic shapes (circle, square, triangle) and primary colors.
* Universalism: Creating a design language stripped of nationalistic or historical ornament.
* Relationship: Laid the groundwork for modernism by championing sans-serif type and asymmetrical, functional layouts.

2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
* Background: Post-WWII Switzerland; sought a "universal" and objective visual language for a globalizing world.
* Key Figures: Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Emil Ruder.
* Core Principles:
* The Mathematical Grid: A strict, invisible structure used to organize all page elements.
* Objectivity: The designer acts as a neutral messenger; absence of personal expression or illustration.
* Typography: Reliance on clean sans-serifs (Helvetica, Univers) and flush-left, ragged-right alignment.
* Relationship to Bauhaus:
* Inherited: The focus on clarity, sans-serif type, and functionalism.
* Refined: Transformed the experimentalism of the Bauhaus into a rigid, dogmatic, and repeatable system.

3. New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)
* Background: Emerged at the Basel School of Design as a reaction against the perceived coldness and stagnation of the Swiss Style.
* Key Figures: Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Dan Friedman.
* Core Principles:
* Deconstruction: Intentionally breaking the grid to create visual tension and depth.
* Intuition over Logic: Design based on texture, layering, and "vibe" rather than strict rules.
* Experimental Type: Frequent use of wide letter-spacing, "stair-step" alignment, and varying weights within words.
* Relationship to Swiss Style:
* Inherited: High-level technical precision and deep knowledge of typographic history.
* Rejected: Abandoned the idea of "objectivity" and the rigid grid in favor of expressive, postmodern complexity.
