## Prompt 1

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt name:** Design Movements Concept Map
- **What I sent:**

```
Generate a simple and very short concept map describing these three design movements based on core principles, key figures, background, and their relationship to each other:

- Bauhaus (1919–1933)

- International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)

- New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)


Convert concept map into plaintext with bullet points specific to each movement
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

*[1–3 sentences: what was useful, what was wrong, what you kept]*

A bulleted layout of the three movements and information regarding their origins, key characteristics, important figures, and influence. While some of the information was generated correctly, I decided to switch some sections with other responses from previous prompts that I felt explained details better, or rewrote them to accurately reflect the history.

*[Did you pin it? Discard it? Edit it? Promote it to AGENTS.md?]*

Edited first before pinning it to CURATOR_NOTES.md "Concept Map" section.

## Prompt 2

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt name:** Design Movements Key Terms
- **What I sent:**

```
Create a list of 20 professional domain-specific words used to define the following design movements:

- Bauhaus (1919–1933)

- International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)

- New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)


Make sure to note which movement the term applies to, and write a small and simple definition.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**
  
Return 20 key characteristics, where 6 to 7 words were designated for a specific design movement. Change a few terms that didn't relate to the movement or had a vague definition.
- **What I did with it:**

Edited some terms, chose 15 terms to pin into AGENTS.md "Controlled Vocabulary" section.

## Prompt 3

- **Phase:** Critique
- **Prompt name:** Walter Gropius Expert Critique
- **What I sent:**

```
Review my Curator Card about the Bauhaus school as if you were Walter Gropius

Based on Gropius' background, known positions, and beliefs:

  - Critique the information given  by its accuracy, vocabulary, and tone

  - Discuss anything information he would challenge (flag it)


If you are unsure about a certain fact, write VERIFY instead of guessing.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

Return a satisfactory reflection on the information presented; however, two vocabulary terms, “Form Follows Function” and “Geometric Abstraction,” were flagged due to their tone and alignment with the objectives of the Bauhaus school.

- **What I did with it:**
  
Although I understood the reasons provided against those two terms, the replacement terms suggested would require additional context to grasp fully. Since I want to keep my curator card short, I decided to reject the replacements and keep the original vocabulary terms.
