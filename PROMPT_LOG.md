## Prompt 1

- **Prompt name:** Design Movement Concept Map
- **What I sent:**

```
[Generate a simple and very short concept map describing these three design movements based on core principles, key figures, background, and their relationship to each other:

- Bauhaus (1919–1933)

- International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)

- New Wave Typography / Swiss Punk (1970s–1980s)



Convert concept map into plaintext with bullet points specific to each movement]
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

*[1–3 sentences: what was useful, what was wrong, what you kept]*

- A bulleted layout of the three movements and information regarding their origins, key characteristics, important figures, and influence. While some of the information was generated correctly, I decided to switch some sections with other responses from previous prompts that I felt explained details better, or rewrote them to accurately reflect the history.

*[Did you pin it? Discard it? Edit it? Promote it to AGENTS.md?]*
