## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

*[Write 2–3 sentences. What did the AI say? Why did it feel wrong? What source confirmed or denied it?]*

Gemini AI initially stated that the Bauhaus operated at three locations simultaneously. I recalled learning that the school was first established in Weimar, but there was no mention of any other buildings. I checked the article by UNESCO, which explained that the school relocated to Dessau and then Berlin after the first building closed in Weimar, so I corrected and rewrote the sentence from the AI to convey the actual statement.
