    <!-- Card 1: Bauhaus -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Initially founded in Weimar, Germany by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to unify different artistic disciplines into a Gesamtkunstwerk, a "total work of art." The movement discarded historical ornament in favor of the principle "Form Follows Function," adhering to objects suited for utility. The curriculum, shaped by painters like Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, began with the Vorkurs, where students experimented with material properties, color theory, and geometric abstraction. The school moved to Dessau and later Berlin before its closure, leaving a legacy of industrial design that integrated art into every aspect of modern architecture.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Art Deco, because Bauhaus emphasizes industrial utility and the removal of ornament, whereas Art Deco focuses on decorative luxury and extravagance.
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta accountability">
        <strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified this by checking the dates of the Weimar, Dessau, and Berlin phases and the curriculum structure of the Vorkurs by cross-referencing Arieh Sharon's 1929 work under the Bauhaus preliminary course provided by MoMA and the UNESCO World Heritage architectural descriptions for the school sites.

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Originating in Switzerland and Germany, the Swiss Style—also known as the International Typographic Style—refined the principles of the Bauhaus into a rational and mathematical design language. Key educators of the Swiss Style, including Emil Ruder and Armin Hofmann, emphasized the importance of contrast, asymmetrical balance, and the use of negative space. Josef Müller-Brockmann played a pivotal role in establishing a strict grid system for the movement, ensuring consistent layouts for global communication. Swiss Style emphasized objective photography and the use of sans-serif typefaces such as Helvetica to strip away individual expression for logic and legibility. The movement achieved a clean, structured aesthetic, becoming the international standard for corporate and universal design.</p>

      </p>
      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Minimalism, because Swiss Style is a specific communication methodology based on mathematical grids, while Minimalism is a broader aesthetic of reduction.
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta accountability">
        <strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified this by checking The Archive (FGD1) analysis of Müller-Brockmann’s "Beethoven" poster, which maps its specific grid construction, and the Cooper Hewitt "Harmony of Contrasts" article, which validates Hofmann’s role in establishing the movement's focus on objective forms and the elimination of decorative "noise."

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>New Wave Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">Swiss Punk · 1970s–1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Emerged from the Basel School of Design in Switzerland, New Wave typography developed as a Postmodernism reaction against the rigid constraints of the Swiss Style. Lead pioneer Wolfgang Weingart was among the first to break the traditional Swiss design rules, employing a deconstructed grid to create intentional visual tension and convoluted compositions that challenge viewers’ perception. Designers like April Greiman further expanded the movement by embracing layering typography, often overlapping text and graphics to build depth. By integrating irregular letterspacing and mixed type weights, New Wave typography moved away from neutrality toward expressive, jagged visual rhythms. This shift prioritized individual interpretation and subjectivity over the sterile, logical systems of earlier modern design.

        <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/172729">Does It Make Sense? by April Greiman (MoMA)</a>
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Grunge Typography, because New Wave specifically subverts professional Swiss design principles through technical deconstruction, whereas Grunge is a total rejection of professional typesetting.
      </p>
      <p class="card-meta accountability">
        <strong>Accountability:</strong> I verified this by checking checking the V&A Museum archives, which describe how Wolfgang Weingart utilized his teaching position at the Basel School of Design to lead a "rebellion" against the Swiss grid, creating New Wave, and the MoMA entry for Greiman’s "Does It Make Sense?", which confirms the movement's move into element layering and the deconstruction of traditional page layouts.
